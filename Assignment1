1)Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.
def Addition(x,y):
  return(x+y)

2)Write a function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the sum of those numbers.
def ListAddition(*nums):
  y=0
  for num in nums:
    y=y+num
  return(y)

3) Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns the length of that string.
y=[]
def wordcount(*words):
  for word in words:
    y.append(len(word))
  return(y)  

4) Write a function that takes a list of strings as an argument and returns the length of the longest string in the list.
def maxword(*words):
  z=0
  max=len(words[0])
  for word in words:
    if(len(word)>max):
      z=words.index(word)
  return(len(words[z]))

5)Write a function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns the average of those numbers.
def average(*nums):
  x=len(nums)
  y=0
  for num in nums:
    y=y+num
  return(y/x) 
  
6) Write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns True if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) and False otherwise.
def palindrome(string):
  if string[:]== string[::-1]:
    print("palindrome")
  else:
    print("Not palindrome") 

7) Write a function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list.
def even(*nums):
  EVnum=[]
  for num in nums:
    if num%2==0:
      EVnum.append(num)
  return(EVnum)  

8) Write a function that takes a list of numbers as an argument and returns a new list containing the squares of those numbers.
def sqr(*nums):
  SQRnum=[]
  for num in nums:
    SQRnum.append(num**2)
  return(SQRnum)
